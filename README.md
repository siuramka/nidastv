# Frontend for Twitch broadcast archiving
React app to display video and chat of livestreams and historical chat data. 

# backend
The backend is for caching some API requests with Redis. Implemented this because otherwise frontend user would have spammed the emoji API provider every refresh, now it just asks the backend for cached data.
